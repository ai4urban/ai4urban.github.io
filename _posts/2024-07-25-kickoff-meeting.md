Key objectives include sharing cutting-edge research, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and funding opportunities, listening to voices from industry and communities, and developing actionable strategies to integrate AI technologies into urban planning and policy. By the end of the workshop, participants will have identified existing problems in the urban environment and practical AI-driven solutions to advance the development of smart, sustainable, and resilient cities.Â
