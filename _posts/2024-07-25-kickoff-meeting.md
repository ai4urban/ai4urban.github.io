<!-- We plan to host the first workshop on 25 July 2024 at Imperial College London with our collaboraters and partners. Details to be confirmed. -->

The theme of this workshop is: "Healthy People and Healthy Planet: AI for Decarbonized, Healthy, Inspiring, and Energy Positive Cities." It aims to bring together leading experts, researchers, and practitioners to explore the transformative potential of artificial intelligence in urban sustainability. The meeting will focus on how AI can be leveraged to reduce carbon emissions, enhance public health, inspire innovative urban design, and create energy-positive environments. Key objectives include sharing cutting-edge research, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and funding opportunities, listening to voices from industry and communities, and developing actionable strategies to integrate AI technologies into urban planning and policy. By the end of the workshop, participants will have identified existing problems in the urban environment and practical AI-driven solutions to advance the development of smart, sustainable, and resilient cities.Â
