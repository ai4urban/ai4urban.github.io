## Aims

Delivering more equitable, resource efficient, healthier homes, whilst achieving COP 29 climate change obligations to ensure that ‘**1.5 is kept alive**’, demands a major shift in Planning, Housing, Transport and Environmental Policies. 

Healthy People, Healthy Planet (HP2), founded by Imperial College and the Universities of New York, Surrey, Southampton plus climate tech experts -  OpenWeather, aims to navigate the Planning Minefield by ensuring future decision-making is driven by **data**, **science**, and **collaboration**.
	
HP2 is developing integrated AI/ Digital Twin technologies to empower communities to analyse needs, synthesise and prioritise options and test proposed solutions in a virtual world, thereby minimising risk in the real world. 

## Vision

Shape the cities of tomorrow by integrating innovative technologies, sustainable practices, and inclusive planning. This workshop aims to inspire collaborative solutions that balance economic growth, environmental resilience, and social equity, creating thriving urban environments for future generations.

## Pillars of strategic partnerships

- **Sustainability and Environmental Resilience**: Focus on integrating renewable energy, green infrastructure, and climate-adaptive planning to mitigate environmental challenges and ensure long-term ecological balance.

- **Technological Innovation**: Leverage AI, machine learning, and Digital Twin technologies to optimise urban planning, enhance decision-making, and build smarter, more efficient cities.

- **Equity and Inclusivity**: Promote planning processes that prioritise equitable access to resources, housing, and opportunities for all socio-economic groups, fostering socially cohesive urban environments.

- **Economic Viability**: Ensure urban solutions are cost-effective, scalable, and contribute to sustained economic growth while aligning with climate goals like decarbonization.

- **Health and Well-being**: Address the intersection of urban planning and public health, focusing on creating spaces that enhance physical, mental, and social well-being through greening, safety, and accessibility.

- **Collaboration and Community Engagement**: Foster partnerships between stakeholders—including policymakers, urban planners, technologists, and communities—to co-create solutions that align with shared visions and local needs.
